# 365-days-code-challenge

From the Discord:

This challenge is all about coding every day, week, or fortnight,  for a whole year. 

New challenges would be posted regularly in the challenge specific channels: ðŸ”¥-daily-challenges ðŸ§Š-weekly-challenges âš¡-fortnight-challenges 

These challenges would be focused more on cracking logic, than using 100 different libraries, hence (mostly) any programming language could be used.

Ideally it shouldn't take longer than 1 hour per challenge.

In addition to these regular challenges, some special code challenges would be posted randomly in ðŸ’¨-special-challenges which, unlike the others, could be also group-tasks.
